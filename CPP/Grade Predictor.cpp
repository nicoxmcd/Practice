I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System
Create a grade predictor program for a hypothetical course that comprises the following elements: (i) six homework scores, (ii) two midterm scores,
and (iii) one final. The following weightage is used to arrive at the final cumulative score: 40% from homeworks, 40% from midterms and 20% from the final.
A final letter grade is arrived at based on the following score range: (i) ‘A’ for scores 91--100, (ii) ‘B’ for 81--90, (ii) ‘C’ for 71--80 and D otherwise.

Hope your day is going well! 

My Notes
-----6 cout and cin for homework scores, 0.4 a b c d e f
-----2 cout cin for midterm 0.4, m n
-----1 cout cin for final 0.2, z
-----one if for 91-100 and one else if for 81-90 and one else if for 71-80 for C and else for anything less
