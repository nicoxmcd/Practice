[Program-2] Write a program that accepts an indefinite set of numbers until the user enters “-1”. 
In other words, the program keeps accepting new values until the user provides a “-1” (your program accepts all values, and discards the “-1”). 
When done, the program prints back to the user: 
(i) the sum of all numbers entered (except -1), (ii) the minimum value seen across all numbers (except -1), and (iii) the maximum value across all numbers (except -1).

* the sum is set to 0 because there is no value yet
* to find the maximum integer it is set to the minimum so that whatever is more than it will override it
* to find the minimum integer it is set to the maximum so that whatever is less than it will override it
