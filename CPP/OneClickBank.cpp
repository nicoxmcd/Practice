Your next assignment is to simulate the actions of a realistic online Bank (let’s call this “OneClickBank”).

Check+ or more: Use password protection to perform all transactions. Your code must ask for a passcode before it allows the user to perform any of these functions.
When a user enters the password, your terminal should either print ‘stars’ (*) or print nothing at all (i.e., one can’t see the actual letters being typed on screen).
The initial password can be hard-coded into your program, beyond which the user is free to change the passcode anytime as long as they can input the current passcode.
(Hint: You’ll need to save these passcodes on a file for persistent storage).
