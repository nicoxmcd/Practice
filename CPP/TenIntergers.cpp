[Program-1] Write a program that accepts exactly ten (10) integer numbers from the user.
When the user is done inputting these numbers, the program prints back: 
(i) the sum of the 10 numbers, (ii) the minimum value from the 10 numbers, and (iii) the maximum value from the 10 numbers.

using namespace std;

int main() {
 /*Intialize 4 variables, one for the user input (x), the sum is set to 0 because there is no value yet
 * to find the maximum integer it is set to the minimum so that whatever is more than it will override it
 * to find the minimum integer it is set to the maximum so that whatever is less than it will override it

    int x;
    int sum = 0;
    int max = INT_MIN;

    //For loop stops after 10 loops, using i to iterate :)
