# Golang Practice

Go is a language that was developed by Google for in-house software development, to make their software easier to write, maintain, and build.

Go has become popular in the world of development, often used for writing APIs and DevOps tools. 

Projects can contain many .go files, organized into packages. To start, .go files start with a package declaration and it tells the Go compiler to which package a .go file belongs to.

Import statements allow the use of code from other packages. We can import multiple packages.

Use `func` to denote the start of a function declaration. Usually, you need to invoke function, however, the `main` function is different if it resides in the `main` package. the execuetable produced by building a .go file uses the main function as the starting point.
